4,2008-07-31T21:42:52.667, c#  winforms  type-conversion  opacity , I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.    This is my code:     decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000; this.Opacity = trans;      When I try to build it  I get this error:        Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'.      I tried making  trans  a  double   but then the control doesn't work. This code has worked fine for me in VB.NET in the past.   
6,2008-07-31T22:08:08.620, html  css  css3  internet-explorer-7 , I have an absolutely positioned  div  containing several children  one of which is a relatively positioned  div . When I use a  percentage-based width  on the child  div   it collapses to  0  width on IE7  but not on Firefox or Safari.     If I use  pixel width   it works. If the parent is relatively positioned  the percentage width on the child works.     Is there something I'm missing here?  Is there an easy fix for this besides the  pixel-based width  on the child?  Is there an area of the  CSS  specification that covers this?  
9,2008-07-31T23:40:59.743, c#  .net  datetime , Given a  DateTime  representing a person's birthday  how do I calculate their age?    
11,2008-07-31T23:55:37.967, c#  datediff , Given a specific  DateTime  value  how do I display relative time  like:      2 hours ago   3 days ago   a month ago    
13,2008-08-01T00:42:38.903, html  browser  timezone  timezoneoffset , Is there a standard way for a Web Server to determine what time zone offset a user is in?     Perhaps from an  HTTP  header? Or part of the user-agent description?  
14,2008-08-01T00:59:11.177, .net , What is the difference between   href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a6a2sxy.aspx"  Math.Floor()   and   href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.truncate.aspx"  Math.Truncate()   in .NET?  
16,2008-08-01T04:59:33.643, c#  linq  web-services  .net-3.5 , How do you expose a  LINQ  query as an  ASMX  web service? Usually  from the business tier  I can return a typed  DataSet  or  DataTable  which can be serialized for transport over  ASMX .    How can I do the same for a  LINQ  query? Is there a way to populate a typed  DataSet  or  DataTable  via a  LINQ  query?:      public static MyDataTable CallMySproc()     {         string conn = ...;      MyDatabaseDataContext db = new MyDatabaseDataContext(conn);         MyDataTable dt = new MyDataTable();      // execute a sproc via LINQ     var query = from dr in db.MySproc().AsEnumerable     select dr;      // copy LINQ query resultset into a DataTable -this does not work !         dt = query.CopyToDataTable();      return dt; }      How can I get the resultset of a  LINQ  query into a  DataSet  or  DataTable ? Alternatively  is the  LINQ  query serializeable so that I can expose it as an  ASMX  web service?  
17,2008-08-01T05:09:55.993, mysql  database  binary-data  data-storage , How do I store binary data in   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" MySQL ?  
19,2008-08-01T05:21:22.257, performance  algorithm  language-agnostic  unix  pi , Solutions are welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of p  as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using  #define d constants like  M_PI   or hard-coding the number in.    The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is  in theory  the fastest option  though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests  with built-ins  the  4 * atan(1)  version is fastest on GCC 4.2  because it auto-folds the  atan(1)  into a constant. With  -fno-builtin  specified  the  atan2(0  -1)  version is fastest.    Here's the main testing program ( pitimes.c ):     #include &lt;math.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;  #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) {                                                       \     diff = 0.0;                                                             \     time1 = clock();                                                        \     for (i = 0; i &lt; ITERS; ++i)                                             \         diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \     time2 = clock();                                                        \     printf("%s\t=&gt; %e  time =&gt; %f\n"  #x  diff  diffclock(time2  time1));   \ }  static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1  clock_t time0) {     return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; }  int main() {     int i;     clock_t time1  time2;     double diff;        Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would      * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op)  if -fno-builtin      * is not used.       TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1  1))  #if defined(__GNUC__) &amp;&amp; (defined(__i386__) || defined(__amd64__))     extern double fldpi();     TESTWITH(fldpi()) #endif        Actual tests start here.       TESTWITH(atan2(0  -1))     TESTWITH(acos(-1))     TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1  1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))      return 0; }      And the inline assembly stuff ( fldpi.c )  noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:     double fldpi() {     double pi;     asm("fldpi" : "=t" (pi));     return pi; }      And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing ( build.sh ):     #!/bin/sh gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c  gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m32 -o pitimes1-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o gcc -O3 -Wall              -m32 -o pitimes2-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m32 -o pitimes3-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m64 -o pitimes1-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall              -m64 -o pitimes2-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm      Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too  because the optimisations are different)  I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The  atan2(0  -1)  version still comes out top every time  though.  
24,2008-08-01T12:12:19.350, mysql  database  triggers , If I have a trigger  before the update  on a table  how can I throw an error that prevents the update on that table?  
25,2008-08-01T12:13:50.207, c++  c  sockets  mainframe  zos , I've been having issues getting the C sockets API to work properly in C++. Specifically  although I am including  sys/socket.h   I still get compile time errors telling me that  AF_INET  is not defined. Am I missing something obvious  or could this be related to the fact that I'm doing this coding on  z/OS  and my problems are much more complicated? ;)   <hr    Oh dear. Upon further investigation  I discovered that there is an #ifdef that I'm hitting. Apparently  z/OS  isn't happy unless I define which type of sockets I'm using with a little     #define _OE_SOCKETS      action. Now  I personally have no idea what this OE  SOCKETS  thingy is  and if any  z/OS  sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you)  perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?  
34,2008-08-01T12:30:57.630, actionscript-3  flex  bytearray , How do I forcefully unload a  ByteArray  from memory in ActionScript 3?    I have tried (without success):     byteArray.length = 0; byteArray = new ByteArray();      and     for ( var i:int=0; i &lt; byteArray.length; i++ ) {     byteArray[i] = null; }      What should I do?  
36,2008-08-01T12:35:56.917, sql-server  datatable  rdbms , How can I monitor an SQL Server database for changes to a table without using triggers or modifying the structure of the database in any way? My preferred programming environment is   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" .NET  and C#.    I'd like to be able to support any   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server#Genesis" SQL&nbsp;Server 2000  SP4 or newer. My application is a bolt-on data visualization for another company's product. Our customer base is in the thousands  so I don't want to have to put in requirements that we modify the third-party vendor's table at every installation.    By "changes to a table" I mean changes to table data  not changes to table structure.    Ultimately  I would like the change to trigger an event in my application  instead of having to check for changes at an interval.   <hr    The best course of action given my requirements (no triggers or schema modification  SQL&nbsp;Server 2000 and 2005) seems to be to use the BINARY_CHECKSUM function in   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL" T-SQL . The way I plan to implement is this:    Every X seconds run the following query:     SELECT CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*)) FROM sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);      and compare that against the stored value. If the value has changed  go through the table row by row using the query     select row_id BINARY_CHECKSUM(*) from sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);      and compare the returned checksums against stored values.  
39,2008-08-01T12:43:11.503, c#  .net  vb.net  timer , I am aware that in   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" .NET  there are three timer types (see    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164015.aspx" Comparing the Timer Classes in the .NET Framework Class Library  ). I have chosen a threaded timer as the other types can drift if the main thread is busy  and I need this to be reliable.    The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy.    The issue with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the application closes.    I tried adding a  while true  loop  but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off.  
42,2008-08-01T12:50:18.587, php  plugins  architecture  hook , I am starting a new web application in PHP and this time around I want to create something that people can extend by using a plugin interface. How does one go about writing 'hooks' into their code so that plugins can attach to specific events?  
48,2008-08-01T13:01:17.303, html  form-submit  html-form  submit-button , Let's say you create a Wizard in an HTML form. One button goes back and one goes forward.  Since the  back  button appears first in the markup  when you press Enter it will use that button to submit the form.     Example:     &lt;form&gt;    &lt;input type="text" name="field1" /&gt; &lt;!-- put your cursor in this field and press Enter --&gt;     &lt;input type="submit" name="prev" value="Previous Page" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is the button that will submit --&gt;    &lt;input type="submit" name="next" value="Next Page" /&gt; &lt;!-- But this is the button that I WANT to submit --&gt; &lt;/form&gt;      What I would like to do  is get to decide which button is used to submit the form when a user presses Enter. That way  when you press Enter the Wizard will move to the next page  not the previous. Do you have to use  tabindex  to do this?  
59,2008-08-01T13:14:33.797, c#  linq  .net-3.5 , Let's say I have a  DataTable  with a  Name  column. I want to have a collection of the unique names ordered alphabetically. The following query ignores the order by clause.     var names =     (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows     orderby (string)dr["Name"]     select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct();      Why does the  orderby  not get enforced?  
61,2008-08-01T13:17:20.640, office-2007  file-type , Where can I find a list of the MIME types and identifying characters for Office 2007 files?    I have an upload form that is restricting uploads based on extension and identifying characters  but I cannot seem to find the Office 2007 MIME types.  
66,2008-08-01T13:20:46.890, linq  .net-3.5 , How do you page through a collection in LINQ given that you have a  startIndex  and a  count ?  
72,2008-08-01T13:38:27.133, ruby  rdoc , I've got all these comments that I want to make into 'RDoc comments'  so they can be formatted appropriately and viewed using  ri .  Can anyone get me started on understanding how to use RDoc?  
79,2008-08-01T13:56:33.837, eclipse  svn  aptana  subclipse , The version of Subclipse (1.2.4) currently available through Aptana's automagic Plugins Manager does not work with the newest version of Subversion.    I see on the Subclipse website however that they have 1.4.2 out for Eclipse. So I added a   href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x" new remote update site  to my Update manager. When I tried to install it  it told me I needed Mylyn 3.0.0. So I after much searching I found Mylyn 3.0.0 and added   href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.3" another new remote update site  to my update manager. Then when I tried to install that  it told me I needed org.eclipse.ui 3.3.0 or equivalent.    Looking at the configuration details for Aptana  it looks like it is built against eclipse 3.2.2.    Does anyone know if there is a way to upgrade the version of Eclipse Aptana is built against to 3.3.0? Or if there is some other way to get Subclipse to work with the very newest version of Subversion?    I know this isn't necessarily a "programming" question  but I hope it's ok since it's highly relevant to the programming experience...  
80,2008-08-01T13:57:07.033, flex  actionscript-3  air , I've written a database generation script in   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" SQL  and want to execute it in my   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime" Adobe AIR  application:     Create Table tRole (       roleID integer Primary Key        roleName varchar(40) ); Create Table tFile (     fileID integer Primary Key      fileName varchar(50)      fileDescription varchar(500)      thumbnailID integer      fileFormatID integer      categoryID integer      isFavorite boolean      dateAdded date      globalAccessCount integer      lastAccessTime date      downloadComplete boolean      isNew boolean      isSpotlight boolean      duration varchar(30) ); Create Table tCategory (     categoryID integer Primary Key      categoryName varchar(50)      parent_categoryID integer ); ...      I execute this in Adobe AIR using the following methods:     public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void {     var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName);     var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();     stream.open(file  FileMode.READ)     var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);     NonQuery(strSql); }  public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void {     var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection();     sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH);     var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();     sqlStatement.text = strSQL;     sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection;     try     {         sqlStatement.execute();     }     catch (error:SQLError)     {         Alert.show(error.toString());     } }      No errors are generated  however only  tRole  exists. It seems that it only looks at the first query (up to the semicolon- if I remove it  the query fails). Is there a way to call multiple queries in one statement?  
85,2008-08-01T14:19:52.510, php  sql  database  flat-file , What are your best practices around creating flat file database structures in PHP?  A lot of the more mature PHP flat file frameworks I see out there attempt to implement SQL-like query syntax  which is over the top for my purposes in most cases (I would just use a database at that point).      Are there any elegant tricks out there to get good performance and features with the small code overhead one would want by taking on this problem in the first place? 
88,2008-08-01T14:36:18.640, linux  winapi  visual-c++  unix  timer , So I find myself porting a game  that was originally written for the Win32 API  to Linux (well  porting the OS X port of the Win32 port to Linux). I have implemented  QueryPerformanceCounter  by giving the uSeconds since the process start up:       BOOL QueryPerformanceCounter(LARGE_INTEGER* performanceCount) {     gettime
