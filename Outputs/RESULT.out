ID :1016439	 BODY: Is there a nice way to extract tokens that start with a pre-defined string and end with a pre-defined string?    For example  let's say the starting string is "[" and the ending string is "]".  If I have the following string:    "hello[world]this[[is]me"    The output should be:    token[0] = "world"    token[1] = "[is"    (Note: the second token has a 'start' string in it)
ID :531779	 BODY: I have a question about comparing a string with the empty string in Java. Is there a difference  if I compare a string with the empty string with == or equals? For example:     String s1 = "hi";  if (s1 == "")      or      if (s1.equals(""))      I know that one should compare strings (and objects in general) with equals  and not ==  but I am wondering whether it matters for the empty string. Thank you.

ID :693597	 BODY: Duplicate          href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/47605/java-string-concatenation" java String concatenation       I'm curious what is the difference between the two.    The way I understand the string pool is this:    This creates 3 string objects in the string pool  for 2 of those all references are lost.     String mystr = "str"; mystr += "end";      Doesn't this also create 3 objects in the string pool?     String mystr = "str"; mystr = mystr.concat("end")      I know StringBuilder and StringBuffer are much more efficient in terms of memory usage when there's lots of concatination to be done. I'm just curious if there's any difference between the + operator and concat in terms of memory usage.

ID :390703	 BODY: While looking at online code samples  I have sometimes come across an assignment of a String constant to a String object via the use of the new operator.    For example:     String s; ... s = new String("Hello World");      This  of course  compared to     s = "Hello World";      I'm not familiar with this syntax and have no idea what the purpose or effect would be.  Since String constants typically get stored in the constant pool and then in whatever representation the JVM has for dealing with String constants  would anything even be allocated on the heap?
ID :465627	 BODY: I've read on articles and books that the use of  String s = new String("...");  should be avoided pretty much all the time.

ID :334518	 BODY: I'm a C++ guy learning Java. I'm reading Effective Java and something confused me.

ID :740873	 BODY: I was wondering if there's a language feature in Java in which methods of a superclass would be invisible for members of a subclass:      public class Subclass extends protected Superclass      or something. I'll give an example.    Here is your superclass.     public class A{     public String getA(){...}     public String getB(){...}     public String getC(){...}     public void setA(String a){...}     public void setB(String b){...}     public void setC(String c){...} }      If you want to subclass A while protecting some of its methods  and you can't change access modifyers in methods unless you override them  you'd end up with something like this-     public class B extends A{     private String getA(){return super.getA();}     private String getB(){return super.getB();}//These four methods have     private void setA(String a){super.setA(a);}//to be redeclared.     private void setB(String b){super.setB(b);}      public String getC(){return super.getC();}//These two methods can be     public void setC(String c){super.setC(c);}//removed.     public String getD(){...}     public void setD(String d){...} }      Either that or you can keep a private instance of A and have something like this:     public class B{      private A obj;      private String getA(){return obj.getA();}     private String getB(){return obj.getB();}//These four methods can also     private void setA(String a){obj.setA(a);}//be removed.     private void setB(String b){obj.setB(b);}      public String getC(){return obj.getC();}//These two methods are     public void setC(String c){obj.setC(c);}//redeclared.     public String getD(){...}     public void setD(String d){...} }      Can you have something that takes both in a way that you don't have to redeclare any methods?

ID :1190031	 BODY: This is a question that arose mostly of pure curiosity (and killing some time). I'm asking specifically about Java for the sake of concreteness.    What happens  in memory  if I concatenate a string (any string) with an empty string  e.g.:     String s = "any old string"; s += "";      I know that afterward  the contents of s will still be "any old string"  since an empty ASCII string is stored in memory as just an ASCII null (since  at least in Java  strings are always null-terminated). But I am curious to know if Java (the compiler? the VM?) performs enough optimization to know that s will be unchanged  and it can just completely omit that instruction in the bytecode  or if something different happens at compile and run times.
ID :457655	 BODY: I have a Java program that runs msinfo32.exe (system information)in an external process and then reads the file content produced by msinfo32.exe. When the Java program loads the file content into a String  the String characters are unreadable.

However when running on one instance of Windows2003  only UTF-16LE (little endian) results in a printable string.    How can I know ahead of time which character encoding to use?

ID :568852	 BODY: duplicate:   href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/527595/split-string" How do I split a concatenated string into multiple floating point values?     I'm have string like this      200209151422010231.10408360.00502240.105090.0200209151423010231.10408360.00502289.605090.0       i want to split this      200209151422010231.10408360.00502240.105090.0 200209151423010231.10408360.00502289.605090.0      and store int Array when 0x01 value occurs in the string because string length is not fixed. i have done splitting like this char 0x01;  String packetArray[] = packets.split(packets sp);  but its showing array size 1 only means its not splitting the data.    i want to split string by hexadecimal value not by dot or any character
ID :704319	 BODY: Hi  please see the following code.     String s = "Monday"; if(s.subString(0 3).equals("Mon"){}  String s2 = new String(s.subString(0 3)); String s3 = s.subString(0 3);      I know that line 2 will still point to "Monday" and have a new String object with the offset and count set to 0 3.    The line 4 will create a new String "Mon" in string pool and point to it.    But not sure what about line 5 whether it will behave like line 2 or line 4.     If i am wrong for line 2 or 4 also please correct.. Thanks
ID :1347312	 BODY: I have a class called ArionFileExtractor in a .java file of the same name.      public class ArionFileExtractor {  public String ArionFileExtractor (String fName  String startText  String endText) {     String afExtract = "";     // Extract string from fName into afExtract in code I won't show here     return afExtract; }      However  when I try to invoke ArionFileExtractor in another .java file  as follows:     String afe = ArionFileExtractor("gibberish.txt"  "foo"  "/foo");      NetBeans informs me that there are incompatible types and that java.lang.String is required. But I coded ArionFileExtractor to return the standard string type  which is java.lang.string.     I am wondering  can my ArionFileExtractor constructor legally return a String?    I very much appreciate any tips or pointers on what I'm doing wrong here.

ID :1340231	 BODY: In C# you can define delegates anonymously (even though they are nothing more than syntactic sugar).

ID :1295934	 BODY: I want to store a byte array wrapped in a String object.  Here's the scenario   <ol   The user enters a password.   The bytes of that password are obtained using the getBytes() String method.   They bytes are encrypted using java's crypo package.   Those bytes are then converted into a String using the constructor new String(bytes[])   That String is stored  or otherwise passed around (NOT changed)   The bytes of that String are obtained and they are different then the encoded bytes.  </ol    Here's a snippet of code that describes what I'm talking about.     String s = "test123"; byte[] a = s.getBytes(); byte[] b = env.encrypt(a); String t = new String(b); byte[] c = t.getBytes(); byte[] d = env.decrypt(c);      Where env.encrypt() and env.decrypt() do the encryption and decryption.
